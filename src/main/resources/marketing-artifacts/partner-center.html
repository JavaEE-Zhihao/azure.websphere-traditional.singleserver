<h1>Short description</h1>
<p>Provisions a single instance of IBM WebSphere Application Server (traditional) on an Azure VM,
including the Administrative Console.</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>IBM WebSphere Application Server (traditional) is an industry-leading Java runtime powering some of the most mission critical
enterprise applications across geographies and environments. This solution automates most boilerplate steps to provision a single
WebSphere instance on an Azure Virtual Machine. Once initial provisioning is complete, you are completely free to customize deployments
further. The solution is jointly developed by IBM and Microsoft.</p>
<p>The following resources are automatically provisioned by the offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM with fixes</li>
<li>Latest WebSphere Application Server Base 9.0.5.x instance with fixes (<strong>WAS_INSTALL_ROOT</strong> is
<strong>/datadrive/IBM/WebSphere/Base/V9</strong>).</li>
<li>Administrative Console</li>
<li>Latest IBM JDK 8 with fixes (<strong>JAVA_HOME</strong> is <strong>${WAS_INSTALL_ROOT}/java/8.0</strong>).</li>
<li>Configured data source connection (Db2, Oracle DB, Azure SQL) - optional</li>
<li>Virtual network and subnet (alternatively, you can deploy to an existing virtual network)</li>
<li>Network security group</li>
<li>Network interface with public IP address</li>
<li>OS and data disk attached to VM</li>
</ul>
<p>This offer includes both evaluation and Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) options for WebSphere. When using BYOL you will be required to
enter your registered IBM ID prior to successfully deploying this offer and your IBM ID must have active WebSphere entitlements
associated with it. If you find that provisioning fails due to lack of entitlements, please contact the primary or secondary contacts for
your IBM Passport Advantage Site who should be able to grant you access. The evaluation option is limited to 60 days, at which point you
must remove the deployment or acquire entitlement.</p>
<p>IBM and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step instructions on getting started with WebSphere and RHEL without automated
provisioning.</p>
<p>IBM and Microsoft provide similar solutions targeting WebSphere ND on a cluster of VMs,
WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) and WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
